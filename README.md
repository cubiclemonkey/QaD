The goal of this repo is to provide some low level access to the semantics of DayZ log files.

I keep seeing fancy log searches that give you good functionality but you have to know what you're looking for.

I've found better results when doing a specific text/string search of a broad range and then finding common data points between them.

Rule No 1: Nothing to install or Mods to download to your DayZ server

Rule No 2: Doesn't require admin privileges to use

Rule No 3: Simple, basic text output based on matching strings from log files

The biggest hurdles I see is that all DayZ servers are arranged differently by their file structure.

I'm still sorting out how to take that into account while still making this accessible.

Your feedback is greatly appreciated.
